\begin{claim}
 Let S denote the set of natural numbers which are perfect squares, and define
$A :=$  \{m \subseteq \mathbb{N} : 4  $\mid m$ or $4 \mid \(m - 1\)\}
=$\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, . . . \}$.
Prove that $S \subseteq A.
\end{claim}

\medskip

\textbf{Method}: We will prove this directly 
\begin{proof}
Let $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Because we know that all natural numbers are either even or odd, we may say that $c = 2k$ or $c = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Using the fact that a perfect square is equal to two equal integers multiplied by each other, we may say that all perfect squares fit into one of the following forms: \[ (2k)^2 = 4k^2\]  \[ (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\]
One can see that both of these form fit into the definition of the set A, where they are both natural numbers because $(2k)^2$ and $(2k+1)^2$ are both natural number because $k \in \mathbb{N}$. If we define these forms as some $b \in \mathbb{N}$, then either  $4 \mid b$ or $4 \mid (b-1)$ because $4k^2$ (which is b) is divisible by 4 because it is a natural number multiplied by 4. $4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1$ (which is b-1)is also divisible by 4 because it is a natural number multiplied by 4. Because of this, we can say that every element in S is also in A, therefore $S \subseteq A$ 

\end{proof}
