\begin{claim}
Let A be a set, and suppose both T and S are relations on A. Then the intersection
$T \cap S$ is also a relation on A. Prove that if T and S are equivalence relations, then $T \cap S$ is also an equivalence relation
\end{claim}

\medskip

\textbf{Method}: We will prove this directly
\begin{proof}
Let R be the relation $T \cap S$ where both T and S are equivalence relations. Therefore, 
\[xRy \text{ iff } xTy \land xSy\]
To show that R is also an equivalence relation, it must be symmetric, reflexive and transitive. 

Because we know that both T and S are reflexive, we may say that 
\[\forall x \in A,  \quad xTx \land xSx\]
Therefore, because we know that R is the set $(x,y) \in S, (x,y) \in T$, and $xTx \land xSx$ then: 
\[\forall x \in A \quad x R x\]
Therefore, R is reflexive. 

Now, suppose $(x,y) \in A \text{ such that } xRy$. This implies $xSy \land xTy$. Because S and T are equivalence relations (they are symmetric), we may also say that $ySx \land yTx$. Because $(y,x) \subseteq S$ and $(y,x) \subseteq T$, we may also say that $(y,x) \subseteq R$. Therefore R is symmetric.

Now, let $x,y,z \in A$ s.t. $xRy \text{ and } yRz$. This implies $xSy \land ySz$ and $xTy \land yTz$. Because both S and T are transitive, we may also say that $aSz \land aTz$. Because $(a,z) \subseteq S \land (a,z) \subseteq T$, then $(a,z) \subseteq R$. This shows transitivity. 
 \par
Therefore, because R = $S \cap T$, when S and T are equivalence relations, $S \cap T$ is also an equivalence relation.

\end{proof}
