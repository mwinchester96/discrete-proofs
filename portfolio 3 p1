\begin{claim}
The set difference of two sets, A and B, is defined as:
\[A - B := \{x \in A : x \notin B\}\]
Prove that for any sets A, B, and C,
\[A - (B \cup C) = (A - B) \cap (A - C)\]
\end{claim}

\medskip

\textbf{Method}: We will prove this by double containment 
\begin{proof}

Let $x \in A - (B \cup C)$, which means that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B \cup C$. Since $x \notin B \cup C$, we know that $x \notin B$ and $x \notin C$. Therefore, $x \in A$, $x \notin B$ and $x \notin C$.
\medskip


If we look at the right hand side of the claim, we can re express the statement $(A - B) \cap (A - C)$ as: 
\[\{x \in A : x \notin B\} \cap \{x \in A : x \notin C\}\]
Which is equivalent to the set: 
\[\{x \in A : x \notin B : x \notin C\}\] 
This is because the intersection takes only the x where all of the parameters are met in both sets. 

Therefore, 
\[A - (B \cup C) \subseteq (A - B) \cap (A - C)\]

If we first look at the right side, we let
\[\{y \in A : y \notin B\} \cap \{y \in A : y \notin C\}\]

Because of this, $y \in A$ and $y \notin B,C$. Taking this to the statement on the left, we have 

\[y \in A - (B \cup C)\]

Which means $y \in A$ and $y \notin B \cup C$, which means $y \notin B$ and $y \notin C$. 

Given these sets, \[(A - B) \cap (A - C) \subseteq A - (B \cup C)\]

Because 
\[(A - B) \cap (A - C) \subseteq A - (B \cup C)\]
and 
\[A - (B \cup C) \subseteq (A - B) \cap (A - C)\]
then 
\[A - (B \cup C) = (A - B) \cap (A - C)\]
by double containment.




\end{proof}
