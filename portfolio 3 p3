\begin{claim}
Let m and n be distinct positive integers, and let $N = m \times n$. Let
$B := \{k \in Z : 1 \leq k \leq N,$ and at least one of m, n divides k $\}$.
Prove that $\mid$B$\mid  <$ m + n.

\end{claim}

\medskip

\textbf{Method}: We will prove this directly 
\begin{proof}

Because either m or n divides k, we may say that either $k = mc$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$ or $k = nd$ for some $d \in \mathbb{Z}$. Because 
$1 \leq k \leq N$ and $N = m \times n$, the maximum value for c is n and the maximum value for d is m. 
If they were any higher, k would be greater than N. Therefore, the values for k when $k = mc$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$ are:

\[\{m \times 1, m \times 2, m \times 3... m \times n\}\]

And the values for k when $k = nd$ for some $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ are:

\[\{n \times 1, n \times 2, n \times 3... n \times m\}\]

This is the best case because we are assuming that there is no overlap in between the sets of $mc$ and $nd$ except for when c = n and d = m, because $m \times n = n \times m$. 

All of these values are unique except for the last values, $m \times n$. Therefore, in the best case, $\mid B \mid = m + n-1$. Because of this,  $\mid$B$\mid  <$ m + n.
\end{proof}
