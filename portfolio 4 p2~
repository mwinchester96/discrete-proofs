\begin{claim}
Suppose R is a relation on a set A. Prove that R is symmetric if and only if $R = R^{-1}$
\end{claim}

\medskip

\textbf{Method}: We will prove this by double containment
\begin{proof}
Let R be symmetric and let $x R y$ which means $(x,y) \in R$. Therefore $y R x$ because R is symmetric. This implies that 
\[x R^{-1} y\]
because it is the inverse of R. Therefore because $(x,y) \in R$ and $(x,y) \in R^{-1}$, this means 
\[R \subseteq R^{-1}\]

Let $x R^{-1} y$ and let $R^{-1}$ be symmetric. Because $R^{-1}$ is symmetric,
\[(y,x) \in R^{-1}\]
Therefore $(x,y \in R)$ because R is the inverse of $R^{-1}$. Because $(x,y) \in R$ and $(x,y) \in R^{-1}$ then 
\[R^{-1} \subseteq R\]

Because both $R^{-1} \subseteq R$ and $R \subseteq R^{-1}$, then $R = R^{-1}$

Let $R = R^{-1}$ and let $(x,y) \in R$. Therefore $(y,x) \in R^{-1}$. Because $R = R^{-1}$, $(y,x) \in R$. Because $(x,y) \in R$ implies that $(y,x) \in R$, R is symmetric. Because R is symmetric, $R^{-1}$ is also symmetric. Therefore, R is symmetric iff $R = R^{-1}$
\end{proof}
